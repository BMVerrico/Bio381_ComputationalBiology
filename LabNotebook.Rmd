1. how to think on paper
2. how to use modern computational tools for science 
3. foundational methods in computer programming (also can be applied to perl, java, C++)
4. experimental design
5. publication quality graphics in R
6. students teach R package
7. probability distributions to simulate data

**GitHub**

* point of it is version control = systematically organize different versions of document
* git = version control software
* GitHub = free remove public website where project is stored (hosts git software)
* good with multiple authors on a document
* cloning: create a local copy of your repository, which is made up of files (any document)
and what git creates to keep track of your files that you are working on
* $6/month -- private repository 
* commit = set of recorded changes to the repostory (snapshot of data and datafiles)
* commit = to create a commit and description of it

```{}
Example:

---------> TIME
A A'
B B
C delete C
* D
  ~
  
* COMMIT WITH JUST ABC
~ COMMIT WITH A' B delete C and creation of D
(each time something is changed, add a new commit (with a unique id) with brief description

-o-o-o-o-o master branch of commits
		\ (fork)
		o-o-o-o-o (last o= head of branch)
```

* git keeps track of only the changes and then reconstructs previous versions of the files
* if a mistake is made, then you return the system back to the previous commit
* can create fork and then go on another path

* do work. make commit. push changes to GitHub, which updates repository online
* pull latest version of repository from GitHub
* GitHub desktop has synchronize which pushes and pulls, also updates webpage 
* ng only looks at webpage not repository 
* index page is the main core page for the webpage, can link off of that though
* no one can change webpage unless listed on GitHub
* each repo can have it's own webpage/portfolio

* no uncommitted changes means the local version and github version are synched and up to date
* ng hits sync just to make sure

* you are always working on the local respo. 
* commit to master is local, it does not sync to online
* sync is needed to push to GitHub site.

* GitHub only cares about files. not the folders/directory. the directory is needed to 
locate the file, but that is all.
* if you have a directory without a file, then it will not be recognized on GitHub
* if there are files that you do not want on GitHub, do a GitHub ignore directory

* RSTUDIO PROJECT IS USEFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MANY FILES WITHIN THE PROJECT AND CALL UPON DIFFERENT OBJECTS WITHOUT HAVING TO RUN ALL OF THE CODE. 
* To make a webpage, need an "index" file (saved index.rmd)
* To make a fancy webpage
  + make a repo called BMVerrico.github.io
  + download template (jekyll)
  + move to repo
  + commit, sync, etc. make changes. 
  + read the README file!

#### General good practices 
* Touch type: should be around 60-70words/minute
  * BMV get yo' stuff together
  
* Notebook: get a good one! 
  * Thinking on paper = key!
  
* Buy real books.
  
#### Scientific method
  * inductive method: obs- hypothesis- predictions-back to obs
    * if predictions are not met, make a new hypothesis
    * change until hypothesis encompasses original observations and updated ones
  * hypothetic deductive method (hopper's method): obs- many hypotheses (h1, h2,h3) that may account for the original observations- many predictions (p1,p2,p3)
    * the predictions and hypotheses should be as distinct as possible
    * some operational way to falsify hypothesis
    * ideally we have one hypothesis that can withstand repeated testing with evidence to support
  * statistical null hypothesis (Ho): sampling is different than null (0) 
    * p < 0.05.. probability that the data we observed given the null hypothesis (which is often noise and/or sampling error)
    * p(data|Ho)
    
#### Alternative to hypothesis testing
  * exploratory data analysis: see what the data look like
    * summaries, plots, figures
    * problem: we are freaking good at finding patterns in the data but they do not always exist!
    * pretty prevalent in big data sets (data science)
  * Parameter estimation and bayesian analysis (estimating the coefs for the models rather than testing hypotheses)
    
#### Tools to help with all of this
**1. Cause and effect diagrams**

```{}

A B : null hypothesis (no relationship)
A -> B : alt
B -> A : alt
B -> <- A : alt

Look at correlation of A and B and might see a positive linear pattern, but we cannot distinguish between the three possibilities. BECAUSE CORRELATION IS NOT ENOUGH. Need experimental data to distinguish. That is, manipulate variable one of the variables and control the other. 

#### To figure out if both A and B are acting on each other, use press and pulse experiments. 

* press- change variable and hold it constant
* pulse- change variable and then let it change

#### Could have a co-variate affecting A and B. 
Co->A->B (indirect chain) but could have Co ->B directly
Co->A but not B
Co->A and Co->B but A and B not related.

The above are mechanisms. We look at patterns in the data but we are trying to get back to the mechanism, rather than just observing the pattern. 
```

**2. Structural equation model and path analysis**
  * Examples: keystone, variable, food-web (bottom up) models
  * Do not just make one model and then use the probs on the arrows to say x,y,z. Instead, build several models and compare them. 
  
**Group literature together into hypotheses that they are testing...this seems like it would be very difficult to do!**

**3. The early graph**
  * Sketch the results if your expt/observation beforehand!
    * Deal with the problem right now rather than after a Summer of collections.
    
```{}
         |
         |
Response |   (insert bars here)
         |
          - - - - - - - - -   
            control   trt.

could have control and treatment equal (p > 0.005)
could have control higher than treatment (p < 0.005)
could have control less than treatment ( p < 0.005)

INTREPTATION AND MECHANISM! 

so, could say adding x to treatment is going to lower something. but that is just restating the hypothesis. what is the mechanism. 

Experimental manipulation should alter one and only 1 thing at a time. 

Control is not always a control, it could simply be unmanipulated.
if heating the treatment, should have the same set up just not turned on to call the other group a control

```

**4. The more interesting null hypothesis**
  * There may be sampling effects/ noise inherently in the system. 
  * Let's say you collect baseline data and have a null hypothesis of a postivie relationship. Your collected data from your experiment do not seem to have a pattern. This does not necessarily mean that there isn't a relationship, but that the relationship is just different and may be more interesting. 
  * [NG example](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/2/10/e1600842.full.pdf)
  
**5. "Dipswitch test"/ look up test**
  * Turn things on or off in the circut
  *Take results from several different experiments and combine into a single table. 
    * Each col is a different experiment
    * Each row is the results 
    * Look at all the combinations and find an interpreation of the rows 
      * Ideally there are 1 or a few rows that support the hypothesis

**6. Logic tree**
  * Series of boxes that might represent particular experiments or tests that were carried out. They represent an outcome of that expt. Simplest: yes or no.
  * Circles represent the conclusion or the stopping point of the tree. 
  * Dipswitch test can be formally mapped like this
  * Diagram/tree can help with flow of manuscript

* Plain text: nothing but printable text chars. that are readable by humans and machines.
  * .txt, .md (markdown format), .rmd ( R markdown format), .tex (LaTeX format)
  
* Typora: use "Command /" to toggle back and forth of how you want the text to appear and how it is "coded". Plain text view to rendered view.
  * Can go back and forth between R and Typora.
  
* Shift return for paragraph break in Slack!
* Rmarkdown uses Latex to show math (use doll hair sign)

* LaTeX editor called Overleaf is worth using when writing a manuscript and multiple people working on the document. 
  * "\title (text)"
  * Can add %% that will not render something (text, link), but useful when editing.
  * Can have different colors/author to track changes.
  
* Rmarkdown: YAML (text between the --- can be changed and it will not show)  
  * put "r" in the fence to show that it is R code, rather than markdown text.
  * do not need to add in a name to the text. can help identify what the code is, but not required to knit
  * control shift and k to knit

Working on path analyses. Used mermaid flow charts and relied heavily on the cheat sheets to do this.

* See FirstHTML.Rmd. Using three languages here (R, markdown, and LaTeX)

* WHEN RENDERING TO HTML THE LATEX COMMANDS ARE IGNORED. NEED TO RENDER TO PDF!

* PDF rendering only comes out one way--latex way. 

* The HTML version can have different themes, colors, fonts.

Chunk options!

* ECHO=TRUE: Execute the code and then print the code to the output.
* Eval=TRUE/FALSE: Are we going to actually run the code?
  * remember that the codes talk to each other. if you do not evaluate a chunk of code with objects called, then you cannot call upon them later unless you define them elsewhere. same is true for packages loaded into R.
* Message=FALSE: Do not show any messages printed to screen after running the code.

* We are using the .rmd but under the hood the itermediate file we are actually working with is .md. This file can then be changed to .html, .pdf, .doc. If you go to settings, you can hold on to the .md file. This is not always kept. 

* .css file is cascading style sheet. can use those from typora to format rmarkdown files.

**Beamer Baby!!**

* Rmarkdown-presentation-choose format
* "##" means a new slide.
* Render bullet something incrementally --check in the settings!
  * good to put bullet points in one at a time. because audience will read everything all at once. adding the bullets in one at a time will force the readers to read the text as you talk about it.
* Can comment in the beamer slides without it showing on the pdf when rendered. do this with LaTeX code ($ or %)
* Need to have all images saved in the directory of the .rmd.

```{}
         typora
           |
.rmd -> (.md) - can make .html, .pdf (based on .md), .pdf (beamer slides)

.Rnw (sweave) --------- .pdf (LaTeX)
```

To change the .rmd to .r (regular script) in the console.

```{}
library(knitr)
purl("FirstHTML.Rmd")
```

To change old R script code to an HTML or PDF without the .rmd file, use the notebook button. 

```{}
 .R --------------------(with notebook)    
  |  (with purl)            |     |
.rmd -> (.md) - can make .html, .pdf (based on .md), .pdf (beamer slides)
```


**To R scripts we go!**

* History and the up arrow in the console shows previous code.
* Try to break the = habit and use <- instead...you can do this BMV!
```{}
control l: clear the consol
control enter: run line(s) of code
control shift enter: run everything in the script
```

### Data types

Homogeneous: same type of data, hetero=opposite

I need to learn how to make tables!

Dimensions  Homogeneous  Heterogeneous
1           Atomic vector   List
2           Matrix        Data frame (kind of list)
n           Array

* Character string "i" (green font)
* Integers (numeric)
* Doubles (doubles precision) (numeric)
* logical (TRUE T, FALSE F) (bright pink font)
* factor (set of character strings, groups, used in statistical models)
