1. how to think on paper
2. how to use modern computational tools for science 
3. foundational methods in computer programming (also can be applied to perl, java, C++)
4. experimental design
5. publication quality graphics in R
6. students teach R package
7. probability distributions to simulate data

**GitHub**

* point of it is version control = systematically organize different versions of document
* git = version control software
* GitHub = free remove public website where project is stored (hosts git software)
* good with multiple authors on a document
* cloning: create a local copy of your repository, which is made up of files (any document)
and what git creates to keep track of your files that you are working on
* $6/month -- private repository 
* commit = set of recorded changes to the repostory (snapshot of data and datafiles)
* commit = to create a commit and description of it

```{}
Example:

---------> TIME
A A'
B B
C delete C
* D
  ~
  
* COMMIT WITH JUST ABC
~ COMMIT WITH A' B delete C and creation of D
(each time something is changed, add a new commit (with a unique id) with brief description

-o-o-o-o-o master branch of commits
		\ (fork)
		o-o-o-o-o (last o= head of branch)
```

* git keeps track of only the changes and then reconstructs previous versions of the files
* if a mistake is made, then you return the system back to the previous commit
* can create fork and then go on another path

* do work. make commit. push changes to GitHub, which updates repository online
* pull latest version of repository from GitHub
* GitHub desktop has synchronize which pushes and pulls, also updates webpage 
* ng only looks at webpage not repository 
* index page is the main core page for the webpage, can link off of that though
* no one can change webpage unless listed on GitHub
* each repo can have it's own webpage/portfolio

* no uncommitted changes means the local version and github version are synched and up to date
* ng hits sync just to make sure

* you are always working on the local respo. 
* commit to master is local, it does not sync to online
* sync is needed to push to GitHub site.

* GitHub only cares about files. not the folders/directory. the directory is needed to 
locate the file, but that is all.
* if you have a directory without a file, then it will not be recognized on GitHub
* if there are files that you do not want on GitHub, do a GitHub ignore directory

* RSTUDIO PROJECT IS USEFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MANY FILES WITHIN THE PROJECT AND CALL UPON DIFFERENT OBJECTS WITHOUT HAVING TO RUN ALL OF THE CODE. 
* To make a webpage, need an "index" file (saved index.rmd)
* To make a fancy webpage
  + make a repo called BMVerrico.github.io
  + download template (jekyll)
  + move to repo
  + commit, sync, etc. make changes. 
  + read the README file!
