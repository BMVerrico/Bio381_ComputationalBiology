2_ how to use modern computational tools for science 
3_ foundational methods in computer programming (also can be applied to perl, java, C++)
4_ experimental design
5_ publication quality graphics in R
6_ students teach R package
7_ probability distributions to simulate data


GitHub
_ point of it is version control = systematically organize different versions of document
_ git = version control software
_ GitHub = free remove public website where project is stored (hosts git software)
_ good with multiple authors on a document
_ cloning: create a local copy of your repository, which is made up of files (any document)
and what git creates to keep track of your files that you are working on
_ $6/month -- private repository 
_ commit = set of recorded changes to the repostory (snapshot of data and datafiles)
_ commit = to create a commit and description of it

####
Example:

---------> TIME
A A'
B B
C delete C
* D
  ~
  
* COMMIT WITH JUST ABC
~ COMMIT WITH A' B delete C and creation of D
(each time something is changed, add a new commit (with a unique id) with brief description

-o-o-o-o-o master branch of commits
		\ (fork)
		o-o-o-o-o (last o= head of branch)
####

_ git keeps track of only the changes and then reconstructs previous versions of the files
_ if a mistake is made, then you return the system back to the previous commit
_ can create fork and then go on another path

_ do work. make commit. push changes to GitHub, which updates repository online
_ pull latest version of repository from GitHub
_ GitHub desktop has synchronize which pushes and pulls, also updates webpage 
_ ng only looks at webpage not repository 
_ index page is the main core page for the webpage, can link off of that though
_ no one can change webpage unless listed on GitHub
_ each repo can have it's own webpage/portfolio

_ no uncommitted changes means the local version and github version are synched and up to date
_ ng hits sync just to make sure


_ you are always working on the local respo. 
_ commit to master is local, it does not sync to online
_ sync is needed to push to GitHub site.

_ GitHub only cares about files. not the folders/directory. the directory is needed to 
locate the file, but that is all it cares about.
_ if you have a directory without a file, then it will not be recognized on GitHub
_ if there are files that you do not want on GitHub, do a GitHub ignore directory
