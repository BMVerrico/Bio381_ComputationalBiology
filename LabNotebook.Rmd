1. how to think on paper
2. how to use modern computational tools for science 
3. foundational methods in computer programming (also can be applied to perl, java, C++)
4. experimental design
5. publication quality graphics in R
6. students teach R package
7. probability distributions to simulate data

**GitHub**

* point of it is version control = systematically organize different versions of document
* git = version control software
* GitHub = free remove public website where project is stored (hosts git software)
* good with multiple authors on a document
* cloning: create a local copy of your repository, which is made up of files (any document)
and what git creates to keep track of your files that you are working on
* $6/month -- private repository 
* commit = set of recorded changes to the repostory (snapshot of data and datafiles)
* commit = to create a commit and description of it

```{}
Example:

---------> TIME
A A'
B B
C delete C
* D
  ~
  
* COMMIT WITH JUST ABC
~ COMMIT WITH A' B delete C and creation of D
(each time something is changed, add a new commit (with a unique id) with brief description

-o-o-o-o-o master branch of commits
		\ (fork)
		o-o-o-o-o (last o= head of branch)
```

* git keeps track of only the changes and then reconstructs previous versions of the files
* if a mistake is made, then you return the system back to the previous commit
* can create fork and then go on another path

* do work. make commit. push changes to GitHub, which updates repository online
* pull latest version of repository from GitHub
* GitHub desktop has synchronize which pushes and pulls, also updates webpage 
* ng only looks at webpage not repository 
* index page is the main core page for the webpage, can link off of that though
* no one can change webpage unless listed on GitHub
* each repo can have it's own webpage/portfolio

* no uncommitted changes means the local version and github version are synched and up to date
* ng hits sync just to make sure

* you are always working on the local respo. 
* commit to master is local, it does not sync to online
* sync is needed to push to GitHub site.

* GitHub only cares about files. not the folders/directory. the directory is needed to 
locate the file, but that is all.
* if you have a directory without a file, then it will not be recognized on GitHub
* if there are files that you do not want on GitHub, do a GitHub ignore directory

* RSTUDIO PROJECT IS USEFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE MANY FILES WITHIN THE PROJECT AND CALL UPON DIFFERENT OBJECTS WITHOUT HAVING TO RUN ALL OF THE CODE. 
* To make a webpage, need an "index" file (saved index.rmd)
* To make a fancy webpage
  + make a repo called BMVerrico.github.io
  + download template (jekyll)
  + move to repo
  + commit, sync, etc. make changes. 
  + read the README file!

#### General good practices 
* Touch type: should be around 60-70words/minute
  * BMV get yo' stuff together
  
* Notebook: get a good one! 
  * Thinking on paper = key!
  
* Buy real books.
  
#### Scientific method
  * inductive method: obs- hypothesis- predictions-back to obs
    * if predictions are not met, make a new hypothesis
    * change until hypothesis encompasses original observations and updated ones
  * hypothetic deductive method (hopper's method): obs- many hypotheses (h1, h2,h3) that may account for the original observations- many predictions (p1,p2,p3)
    * the predictions and hypotheses should be as distinct as possible
    * some operational way to falsify hypothesis
    * ideally we have one hypothesis that can withstand repeated testing with evidence to support
  * statistical null hypothesis (Ho): sampling is different than null (0) 
    * p < 0.05.. probability that the data we observed given the null hypothesis (which is often noise and/or sampling error)
    * p(data|Ho)
    
#### Alternative to hypothesis testing
  * exploratory data analysis: see what the data look like
    * summaries, plots, figures
    * problem: we are freaking good at finding patterns in the data but they do not always exist!
    * pretty prevalent in big data sets (data science)
  * Parameter estimation and bayesian analysis (estimating the coefs for the models rather than testing hypotheses)
    
#### Tools to help with all of this
**1. Cause and effect diagrams**

```{}

A B : null hypothesis (no relationship)
A -> B : alt
B -> A : alt
B -> <- A : alt

Look at correlation of A and B and might see a positive linear pattern, but we cannot distinguish between the three possibilities. BECAUSE CORRELATION IS NOT ENOUGH. Need experimental data to distinguish. That is, manipulate variable one of the variables and control the other. 

#### To figure out if both A and B are acting on each other, use press and pulse experiments. 

* press- change variable and hold it constant
* pulse- change variable and then let it change

#### Could have a co-variate affecting A and B. 
Co->A->B (indirect chain) but could have Co ->B directly
Co->A but not B
Co->A and Co->B but A and B not related.

The above are mechanisms. We look at patterns in the data but we are trying to get back to the mechanism, rather than just observing the pattern. 
```

**2. Structural equation model and path analysis**
  * Examples: keystone, variable, food-web (bottom up) models
  * Do not just make one model and then use the probs on the arrows to say x,y,z. Instead, build several models and compare them. 
  
**Group literature together into hypotheses that they are testing...this seems like it would be very difficult to do!**

**3. The early graph**
  * Sketch the results if your expt/observation beforehand!
    * Deal with the problem right now rather than after a Summer of collections.
    
```{}
         |
         |
Response |   (insert bars here)
         |
          - - - - - - - - -   
            control   trt.

could have control and treatment equal (p > 0.005)
could have control higher than treatment (p < 0.005)
could have control less than treatment ( p < 0.005)

INTREPTATION AND MECHANISM! 

so, could say adding x to treatment is going to lower something. but that is just restating the hypothesis. what is the mechanism. 

Experimental manipulation should alter one and only 1 thing at a time. 

Control is not always a control, it could simply be unmanipulated.
if heating the treatment, should have the same set up just not turned on to call the other group a control

```

**4. The more interesting null hypothesis**
  * There may be sampling effects/ noise inherently in the system. 
  * Let's say you collect baseline data and have a null hypothesis of a postivie relationship. Your collected data from your experiment do not seem to have a pattern. This does not necessarily mean that there isn't a relationship, but that the relationship is just different and may be more interesting. 
  * [NG example](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/2/10/e1600842.full.pdf)
  
**5. "Dipswitch test"/ look up test**
  * Turn things on or off in the circut
  *Take results from several different experiments and combine into a single table. 
    * Each col is a different experiment
    * Each row is the results 
    * Look at all the combinations and find an interpreation of the rows 
      * Ideally there are 1 or a few rows that support the hypothesis

**6. Logic tree**
  * Series of boxes that might represent particular experiments or tests that were carried out. They represent an outcome of that expt. Simplest: yes or no.
  * Circles represent the conclusion or the stopping point of the tree. 
  * Dipswitch test can be formally mapped like this
  * Diagram/tree can help with flow of manuscript
